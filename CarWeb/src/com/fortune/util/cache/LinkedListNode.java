 * built into this class and only requires to reference reassignments. If
 * remove was built into the main LinkedList class, a linear scan would have to
 * be performed to find the correct node to delete.
 *
 * The linked list implementation was specifically written for the CoolServlets
 * cache system. While it can be used as a general purpose linked list, for
 * most applications, it is more suitable to use the linked list that is part
 * of the Java Collections package.
